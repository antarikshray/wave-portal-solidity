# Wave Portal
## Wave Portal Backend on Web3

This project uses Hardhat to deploy and test web3 smart contracts on solidity. The smart contract provides functions to wave and unwave with a message. To deploy we need to create an env file with all details for deployment.

To get hardhat commands

```shell
npx hardhat help
```
